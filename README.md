# üöÄ Problem of the Week (POW) ‚Äì Coding Challenge Repository  

> **‚ÄúWriting code is easy. Writing efficient code? That‚Äôs what separates good programmers from great ones.‚Äù**  

This repository is part of the **Problem of the Week (POW) initiative**, designed exclusively for **BTech CSE Cluster-1 (Hons)** students.  
The goal is simple yet impactful: **build consistency, sharpen problem-solving skills, and master efficient coding under pressure.**

## üéØ Purpose of This Repository
The **Problem of the Week** is more than just solving problems‚Äîit‚Äôs about:  
- Developing a **habit of consistency** in coding  
- Writing **efficient & optimized solutions** (not just correct ones)  
- Exploring **multiple approaches** to the same problem  
- Documenting **time and space complexity** clearly  
- Preparing for **real-world interview challenges**  

By the end of the semester, this repo will reflect not only the number of problems solved but also **growth in code quality and thought process**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Problems are organized **week-wise**. Each week contains 2‚Äì3 coding challenges.  
Every problem has:  
- **One or more solutions** (`solution1.py`, `solution2.cpp`, etc.)  
- A dedicated **README.md** explaining:  
  - Problem statement (brief)  
  - Approach breakdown (from brute force ‚Üí optimized)  
  - Time & space complexity analysis
