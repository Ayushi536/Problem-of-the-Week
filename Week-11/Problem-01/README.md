# üß© Problem of the Week ‚Äì Dropbox Question  
**Company:** Dropbox  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Topics:** Hashing ‚Ä¢ Sliding Window ‚Ä¢ String Matching ‚Ä¢ Two Pointers

## üìñ Problem Description
You are given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word has the same length.  
Find all starting indices in `s` where the substring is a **concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once** (no extra characters).  
If no such substring exists, return an empty list.

## üß† Example
**Input**
s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog"
words = ["cat", "dog"]

**Output**
[0, 13]

Explanation :-

At index 0: "dogcat" ‚Üí "dog" + "cat"
At index 13: "catdog" ‚Üí "cat" + "dog"

‚öôÔ∏è Approach

Each word has equal length k.

Use Sliding Window + Hash Map to check substrings of total length = len(words) * k.

Maintain frequency of words using Counter.

Slide the window in steps of k, track current word counts, and compare with the target count.

Time Complexity: O(N √ó wordLen √ó numWords)
Space Complexity: O(numWords)
